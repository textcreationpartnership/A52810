            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p n="1">1. SUch is the tender love of our bleſſed Redeemer, to his dear Spouſe (the Church) that he hath foretold her of all future Calamities (that ſhould befall her in ſucceeding Generations) in the
<hi>Revelation;</hi> wherein not onely the <hi>fata imperij</hi> [the deſtinies of the Empire] are revealed, but alſo the <hi>fata eccleſiae</hi> [the concernments of the Church] and the former are diſcovered for the ſake of the latter: many great perſons and affairs of the world are indeed Recorded in Scripture, which had been (as many others are) paſſed over in ſilence, ſave only that they <pb n="2" facs="tcp:95127:8"/> are
[<hi>in ordine ad Eccleſiam</hi>] relating to his Church: but eſpecially Chriſt hath <hi>forewarnd</hi> his Church of that great Calamity by
<hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianiſm</hi> that ſhe might be <hi>forearmed</hi> againſt it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Church of God is always under ſome <hi>divine prophecy,</hi> under ſome part of thoſe <hi>unalterable decrees</hi> of Heaven, that were <hi>unſeald</hi> and <hi>reveal'd</hi> by Chriſt to
<hi>John,</hi> and which have their orderly execution in a continued
<hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of Providence in the world: thus Chriſt told his ſervant, that the Churches <hi>firſt Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> (<hi>after his white horſe, his Riding forth conquering and to Conquer in the Goſpel</hi>) ſhould be thoſe 10 perſecutions under <hi>Rome Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. Revel.</hi> 6 3. to the end,
<hi>her Second</hi> (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the dethroning of the Dragon in thoſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Emperors by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great) ſhould be
<hi>that flood</hi> of <hi>Arrianiſm</hi> that <hi>came out of the Dragons mouth,</hi> when <hi>Rome</hi> was <hi>Chriſtian. Revel.</hi> 12.9 13.15. This Hereſie was ſo peſtilential to the Church, that it compelled even Chriſtian Emperors to rage againſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Congregations; as if they had been tearing out their own bowels: then the Churches <hi>third Calamity</hi> ſhould be the double beaſt, Political and Eccleſiaſtical, which like <hi>Samſons</hi> Foxes are tied together by the Tales, and exerciſe the Cruelty of the Dragon under the 7th head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church making up <hi>the great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; then became</hi> Rome
<hi>Antichriſtian. Revel.</hi> 13.1. &amp; 11.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:95127:8"/>3. There be ſundry Enigmatical Intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this <hi>Antichriſt</hi> in the Old Teſtament both in
<hi>Perſons, Names</hi> and <hi>Titles,</hi> all which bear at leaſt a Reſemblance of him as, 1ſt. in <hi>perſon.</hi> Thus <hi>Daniel</hi>'s
<hi>Antiochus</hi> is made a Type of <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Antichriſt</hi> by the moſt judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Interpreters. This <hi>Antiochus</hi> doth not only praefigure his Antitype in name (whoſe name ſignifies an Adverſary or Oppoſer) but alſo in diſpoſition and all manner of practice. 1ſt. in
<hi>diſpoſition, Antiochus</hi> was crafty, of an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent face, and ([<hi>ad omne malum inverecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>] notoriouſly ſhameleſs: ſo
<hi>Antichriſt</hi> hath a <hi>whores forehead,</hi> out facing the day-light of the Goſpel, yea and the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs</hi> himſelf, daring him to the face.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As <hi>Antiochus</hi> reſembles this
<hi>Antichriſt</hi> in diſpoſition, ſo 2dly. in <hi>practice;</hi> as, he war'd againſt <hi>Judas Macabaeus</hi> the Captain general of the people of God, to wit, the <hi>Jews;</hi> ſo this <hi>Antichriſt</hi> wages war againſt Chriſt the Captain General of the Church: as <hi>Antiochus</hi> exalted and magnified himſelf above every God, and <hi>ſpoke morvellous things againſt the God of gods. Dan.</hi> 11.36. So doth
<hi>Antichriſt.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.4. As, he took away the dayly ſacrifice, pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted the Sanctuary, and ſet up the Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Deſolation, ſo doth <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> as he bewitched many with fair Speeches, ſo <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> deceives the world with his Intoxicating Cup of fornication. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.9. Laſtly as <pb n="4" facs="tcp:95127:9"/> he proſper'd <hi>till the Indignation was paſt. Dan.</hi> 11.36. Even ſo muſt <hi>Antichriſt</hi> do.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Thus have we a repreſentation of
<hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> in <hi>Daniel</hi>'s proper name and perſon of
<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus;</hi> ſo ſecondly in <hi>Zacharie</hi>'s appellative name or
<hi>Periphraſis</hi> [of a <hi>fooliſh Shepheard</hi>] by way of eminency, whom he foretells ſhould ariſe in the Church, as a puniſhment for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting Chriſt, <hi>who ſhould eat the fleſh of the fat,</hi> and become as ravenous as a cruel beaſt, <hi>tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their limbs aſunder. Zach.</hi> 11.13.15.16. This Hieroglyphick doth not only ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thoſe Theives and Robbers which were Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds over the Chriſt-killing <hi>Jews. Joh.</hi> 10.10. but alſo that Grand-idol-ſhepheard

Thus
<hi>Antichriſt</hi> is call'd <hi>a Son of perdition,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.3.
<hi>a Deſtroyer,</hi> Rev. 11. and one that ſhall ſink <hi>into the lake of Fire and Brimſtone,</hi> Rev. 17.8. and 19.20. when Chriſt ſhall overcome him, as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Goliah.</hi>
               </p>

<hi>Antichriſt:</hi> let us now come to the New-Teſt. where the <hi>Vail is done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> and where he is without a parable, and plainly characteriz'd, he is by a Prophetick ſpirit ſo punctually, and with ſo many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances deſcribed, as if pointed at by the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and as if that deſcription were an <hi>Hiſtory of things paſt,</hi> and not a
<hi>Prophecy of things to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. The New-Teſt. indeed tells us, <hi>there be many Antichriſts;</hi> as 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.18.

               <p n="9">9. All thoſe grand Hereticks that liv'd in the times of the Evangeliſt <hi>John,</hi> (ſuch as <hi>Ebion, Nicolaus,</hi> and

<hi>Poſitively,</hi> [<hi>who he is,</hi>] of the 1ſt. <hi>Negatively,</hi> ſome would have <hi>Theudas</hi> to be <hi>him,</hi> becauſe he was a great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.36 others <hi>Simon-Magus,</hi> who was a greater Deceiver, and to find <hi>Grotius</hi> (<hi>a man of great learning</hi>) of this Judgment, I much wonder at, which makes ſome fear he plaid the

               </p>
               <p n="16">16. As <hi>Grotius</hi> miſtakes in this of
<hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> ſo in that of the Witneſſes, whom he makes Two Biſhops in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> witneſſing againſt that Sorcerer: Thus, <hi>Dato Vno ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdo, mille ſequuntur,</hi> This Interpretation is full of Abſurdity; for the <hi>Revelation</hi> about the Beaſt and the Witneſſes, <hi>was a Prophecy of things to come,</hi> Revel. 1.1,3. and
4.1. but the Story of <hi>Simon-Magus</hi> was <hi>paſt</hi> and of no ſuch conſequence, though many in <hi>Samaria</hi> and at <hi>Rome,</hi> wondred at this Magician, yet this was nothing to the <hi>whole Worlds wondring after the Beaſt that ſlew the Witneſſes;</hi> and if <hi>Simon</hi> were [the]

               <p n="17">17. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> affirms that Antichriſt muſt be a <hi>Jew,</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> whom the <hi>Jews</hi> muſt receive for their Meſſiah, <hi>Bell de ſum pont. lib.</hi> 3. and
<hi>Remandus de Antichriſto,</hi> ſays further of him, that he muſt Reign in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> three years and half, and at length attempting to mount up to Heaven, ſhall be ſlain by Chriſt on the Mount of <hi>Olives:</hi> and <pb n="11" facs="tcp:95127:12"/> 
                  <hi>Pererius</hi> in <hi>Dan. lib.</hi> 15. adds ſtill more of this traſh, that he muſt not only be Circumciſed and obſerve the Sabbath, but alſo muſt be born in <hi>Babylon:</hi> Thus thoſe <hi>Romaniſts</hi> labours in the very fire with the figments of their own brains, to put <hi>Antichriſt</hi> far of from <hi>Rome,</hi> not any of thoſe notions ſeem ſo much as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, unleſs the laſt of being born in <hi>Babylon,</hi> myſtically taken.</p>
               <p n="18">18. The Abſurdity of this opinion is eaſily detected, for Antichriſt was to ſucceed the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s time and
<hi>John</hi>'s; but the 10 Tribes were caſt off long before, and much more the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> which was the firſt Tribe that forſook the worſhip of God, and fell off to the Gentiles, (which <hi>Jacob</hi> foreſaw, and look'd up to God <hi>for Salvation by Chriſt for them,</hi> Gen. 49.18.) their Idolatry being Recorded, <hi>Judg.</hi> 18.30. and 1
<hi>Kin.</hi> 12.28.29. therefore is there no mention of this Tribe in the Firſt Book of the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> wherein all the other Tribes are mentioned, becauſe they were of a long time Revolted from the true Religion.</p>

               <p n="20">20.

<hi>Tatian</hi> did (though they had low thoughts of it) as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ancient Hereticks had: they never made any Decrees againſt it.</p>

The 2d Doctrine is, <hi>Prohibition of Meats,</hi> which God hath <hi>appointed to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with Thankſgiving.</hi> This is alſo as expreſs and notorious Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which hath <hi>forbidden by Law</hi> that which God <hi>by Law Ordained.</hi> God allows the free uſe of the Creature, but <hi>Rome</hi> reſtrains it by certain Times &amp; Differences at her pleaſure, <hi>Rome</hi> forbids ſome at all times, and all at ſome <pb n="35" facs="tcp:95127:24"/> times to abſtain from ſome kind of Meats, far beyond the <hi>Montaniſts</hi> that never put ſuch ſtreſs on their Faſting Days, as <hi>Rome</hi> does.</p>
               <p n="69">69. <hi>Anſelm</hi> expounds this, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. on this wiſe. The Spirit of God doth manifeſtly (in me and by me) ſay, that in the laſt Times, that is (ſaith he) during the Reign of

               <p n="70">70. Thus it appears from Teſtimonies, how

               <p n="72">72. <hi>No other foundation can any man lay beſides Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. Yet <hi>Rome</hi> hath laid other Foundations (<hi>not holding the Head, Chriſt Col.</hi> 2.18,19.) they overthrow <hi>Chriſts Merits,</hi> by ſetting up <hi>their own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> and Chriſts <hi>Mediation</hi> by making other
<hi>Mediators,</hi> and Chriſts <hi>Satisfaction</hi> in their

<hi>All-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancy</hi> of Chriſts <hi>Sacrifice</hi> by Reiterating
<hi>their Maſs</hi> as a <hi>Sacrifice: Rome</hi> alſo overthrows the very

               <p n="73">73. Beſides, <hi>Rome</hi> denies the Sufficiency of the Scriptures (which are a Foundation Doctrinal, as Chriſt is the Foundation perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal) and forbidding their Laity to read them, they do as much as ſay, the word of God is <pb n="37" facs="tcp:95127:25"/> 
                  <hi>not Neceſſary to Salvation,</hi> neither <hi>Neceſſitate medii,</hi> nor <hi>Neceſſitate praecepti:</hi> So their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Saints, of Angels, of Crucifixes, of Reliques, of Images and of very Wafers, are no better then real Underminings of the ſacred Foundation. Thus it appears they do not only deſtroy that great Fundamental truth of <hi>Juſtification</hi> by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in aſcribing it to Works: but alſo in overthrowing both Chriſt and Scripture.</p>
               <p n="74">74. Many more evidences may be added, as their making a New Rule of Faith, to wit, <hi>Tradition,</hi> a new guide or head of Faith, to wit, <hi>the Pope,</hi> preſcribing Prayers in an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Tongue, attributing the effect of the Sacraments and all Services to the External work, the <hi>Popes</hi> Canonizing of Saints, his Forgiving of ſins in a Magiſterial manner, his creating new Articles of Faith, and making himſelf as Infallible as God. By all which 'tis made as clear as the Sun that the

               <p n="246">246. Thus we ſee there is a <hi>coming of Chriſt</hi> which will <hi>be a Reſtitution of all things,</hi> Acts 3.21.

               <p n="247">247. This is the <hi>Brightneſs of Christs co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,</hi> that brings in <hi>Antichrists</hi> utter extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, 2

               </p>
               <p n="248">248. In the like manner, at the <hi>pouring</hi> out of the 7th <hi>Vial,</hi> in the <hi>Book-prophecy,</hi> it is ſaid [<hi>It is done</hi>] Rev. 16.17. that is, all is fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed concerning

               </p>
               <p n="249">249. Thus we have ſeen at large, how

Now thoſe two laſt clauſes of the Induction are <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate,</hi> but not <hi>contrary:</hi> for

<hi>wasting away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="250">250. But when <hi>Christ</hi> ſhall come with a

Months muſt be <hi>referr'd to the Churches Perſecution</hi> under the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors,
<hi>Reckoning from John Baptiſt,</hi> (that was ſlain by <hi>Herod</hi> the Tetrarch) <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till Peace was given to the Church by</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine.</p>
               <p n="301">301. He takes thoſe 42. <hi>Months</hi> for <hi>Weeks of Years,</hi> by which Reckoning, they make <pb n="132" facs="tcp:95127:73"/> 249. Years; to which, if we add the 30. <hi>Years of Chriſt,</hi> when he was Baptized by
<hi>John,</hi> it amounts to 324. Years after Chriſt, <hi>in which Year</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>Conſtantine the great em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Chriſtian Religion:</hi> To this ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Opinion of this holy Man, I ſhall ſpeak to by and by, (and yet without deriding it as the Popiſh Writers do) when I come to lay down my own Opinion (<hi>ſuch as it is</hi>) on this Subject.</p>
               <p n="302">302. The 2d. Opinion is Dr. <hi>Beards,</hi> (one who hath writ a very Learned Treatiſe of <hi>Antichriſt</hi>) whoſe notions (<hi>in this point</hi>) differs from all others (of the Interpreters afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) about this <hi>Apocalyptick Number;</hi> ſaying, that it concerns not <hi>Antichriſts</hi> Reign, but only the <hi>durance of the firſt Beaſt,</hi> which was the <hi>Roman Empire:</hi> and he gives 2.
<hi>Reaſons</hi> for this his Opinion; Firſt, 'tis ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi>
13.5. that <hi>power was given to the Beaſt</hi> 42. Months or 1260. Years, this he ſays, <hi>agrees with the Event;</hi> for from the firſt foundation of <hi>Rome,</hi> to its <hi>Ruine</hi> by <hi>Theoderick</hi> the <hi>Goth, paſſed juſt ſo many Years,</hi> 1260.</p>
               <p n="303">303. His <hi>Second Reaſon</hi> why this Number holds out the length of the <hi>Civil Empire of Rome,</hi> (perſecuting the primitive Church) and not the <hi>Pontifical</hi> or <hi>Antichriſtian;</hi> is, becauſe (he ſaith) it is not the manner of Holy Scripture to premonſtrate any certain Periods of thoſe <hi>Inteſtine Troubles</hi> which are <pb n="133" facs="tcp:95127:73"/> rais'd up in <hi>the Church</hi> by <hi>falſe Chriſtians;</hi> but only by ſuch as ariſe from <hi>Foreign Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> that <hi>profeſſedly oppoſe</hi> the Truth: As we ſee (ſaith he) in the Perſecution of the <hi>Antient Church</hi> under the

               </p>
               <p n="304">304. Thoſe <hi>Perſecutions</hi> are
<hi>defined</hi> in a certain Number of Years by the <hi>Prophets:</hi> but not that which was executed <hi>by their own Idolatrous Kings,</hi> as
<hi>Jeroboam, Manaſſeh,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe <hi>Ungodly Kings</hi> of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> ſo (ſaith he) thoſe Numbers in the
<hi>Apocalypſe</hi> are not to be referr'd to <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> (who was to be a <hi>Domeſtick Foe,</hi> this is anſwer'd in <hi>Par.</hi> 347.) but to the Bloody Cruelty of thoſe <hi>Heathen Tyrants,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors who (ſaith he) are the <hi>Gentiles that treads under foot the Holy City</hi> 4.2. <hi>Months,</hi> Revel. 11.2. yea he further affirms that this

               <p n="310">310. My 2d. <hi>Reaſon</hi> is, that the
<hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is a general Prophecy of occurences to come <hi>from Johns time,</hi> to the <hi>end of the World,</hi> beginning at the 4th. Chap. to the end of the Book, (as the 3 firſt Chap. contain 7. Epiſtles to 7. particular Churches which were then in being) Chriſt comes to ſhew <hi>John</hi> things that <hi>muſt ſhortly come to paſs,</hi> Rev. 1.1. and the <hi>the time was at hand when thoſe things</hi> (Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to him in a Viſion) ſhould <hi>begin to be put in Execution,</hi> v. 3. then <hi>Ch.</hi> 4.

               <p n="311">311. Now thoſe two things being ſeriouſly ponder'd: 1. That the <hi>Revelation</hi> is not an <hi>Hiſtory of things paſt,</hi> but a <hi>Prophecy of things to come,</hi> which were to
<hi>Commence</hi> after <hi>Johns</hi> writing it, in regard of their firſt beginning: and 2ly. That <hi>John</hi> wrote this Book about 94 Years after Chriſt, thence (I ſay) it may ſtrongly be concluded, that the
<hi>Perſecution</hi> of <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt by <hi>Herod</hi> can be no part of this <hi>Prophetical Viſion,</hi> being a diſpenſation long before executed: and preceded in time not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the <hi>parts of the Prophecy,</hi> but alſo the 7. <hi>Churches then in being.</hi>

                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:95127:75"/>312. I ſhall add other
<hi>Reaſons</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel againſt this Opinion as it hath a coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidency with that of Dr. <hi>Beards,</hi> (about the <hi>Pagan Empire</hi>) it ſhall ſuffice now to ſay, that as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> could not be the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> (ſpoken of in the

15. and 16. <hi>Paragraph</hi>) ſo, much leſs can that Perſecution of the
<hi>Church</hi> before <hi>Chriſts</hi> death, be any part of that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution (foretold of in the <hi>Revelation,</hi>) which
<hi>Chriſt</hi> (<hi>after he was dead, and lived again,</hi> Rev. 1.5.18.) ſhew'd to <hi>John, ſhould afterwards come to paſs.</hi>

               <p n="313">313.

               </p>
               <p n="316">316. Thus my firſt <hi>Argument</hi> or Reaſon (being thus ſtrengthen'd with theſe two Illuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations) conludes effectually againſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors <pb n="139" facs="tcp:95127:76"/> Opinion, that the firſt <hi>Beaſt</hi> is not the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, (ſee more of this Subject in Paragr. 145. &amp; 146.) neither in reſpect of its
<hi>Continuance</hi> nor <hi>Perſecution.</hi> My 2d Reaſon is, the
<hi>Roman Empire</hi> and this <hi>Beaſt</hi> have two differing deſcriptions, (as both Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cotton, &amp;c.</hi> obſerves) for the <hi>Roman</hi> (<hi>Pagan</hi>) <hi>Empire</hi> is deſcrib'd, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.3. with 7. <hi>Heads</hi> and Ten <hi>Horns,</hi> (as this firſt Beaſt is) but with this difference in <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. the
7. <hi>Heads had</hi> 7. <hi>Crowns on their Heads,</hi> but in <hi>Rev.</hi>
13.1. the Crowns are not <hi>on the Heads but on the Horns,</hi> which maketh a great difference both in Place and Number; for in <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. but 7.
<hi>Crowns,</hi> but in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.1. <hi>there be Ten.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="317">317. A 3d <hi>Argument</hi> that will be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding againſt his Opinion is, that it is laid down as a <hi>mark of Reprobation,</hi> and ſo of <hi>Damnation</hi> to give honour to this firſt
<hi>Beaſt, Rev.</hi> 13.8. They that honour this <hi>Beaſt</hi> are ſuch,
<hi>whoſe names are not written in the Lambs book of Life:</hi> as if it were thus ſaid, they ſhall periſh eternally, that yield obedience to this Monſter of Iniquity (as Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains it) but to yield <hi>civil Subjection</hi> to the <hi>Civil Power</hi> (even of a <hi>Nero</hi>) is not <hi>Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but <hi>Duty, Rev.</hi>
13.3,5.</p>
               <p n="318">318. Again a 4th <hi>Argument</hi> is, that the 42 Months (this firſt <hi>Beaſt</hi> had to <hi>continue</hi>) muſt in all likelihood be reckon'd from the <pb n="140" facs="tcp:95127:77"/> 
                  <hi>healing of the deadly Wound.</hi> Now whereas the Doctor makes this term of time to reach from the firſt <hi>Foundation of Rome, to its Ruine</hi> by <hi>Theoderich.</hi> Where can we fix (according to that Notion) either the <hi>receiving,</hi> or the
<hi>healing of this Wound?</hi> Rome <hi>could not be wounded before it was</hi> Rome: and if we fix it on any time after, then it will over-reach its
<hi>ruine</hi> by <hi>Theoderick,</hi> which he pitches upon.</p>
               <p n="319">319. Thoſe <hi>Arguments</hi> may be improv'd againſt the Notion, about the <hi>Civil Rom. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> whether
<hi>Chriſtian or Pagan,</hi> and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding againſt Mr. <hi>Fox</hi>'s Opinion, as well as Dr. <hi>Beard?</hi> I ſhall have an occaſion to ſpeak more of thoſe two <hi>Beasts</hi> afterwards, which will further eneruate thoſe two foreſaid Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: and as the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſaith [that
<hi>God uſes not to praemonſtrate to his Church any certain Periods of her Inteſtine troubles</hi>] I think, the contrary may be evidenc'd even in the very Inſtances of that learned Man: as firſt, in his Inſtance of
<hi>Jeroboam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="320">320. The man of God <hi>ſets down a plain Period of Jeroboams Idolatry,</hi> 1 Kin. 13.2. that <hi>Joſiah</hi> (<hi>by name</hi>)
<hi>ſhould carry out, what Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam brought in:</hi> and though this fell out not till 330 Y. after, yet is it as punctually ſet down in particular Circumſtances, as if it were a <hi>Relation of things paſt, and not a Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of things to come:</hi> compare with it, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 22.1,2. &amp; 23.15,16. Now becauſe <pb n="141" facs="tcp:95127:77"/> the time was long betwixt the <hi>Praediction</hi> and the <hi>Execution;</hi> the Prophecy comes attended with various Confirming Miracles [<hi>as the rending of the Altar, the withering of Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boams hand,</hi> and the <hi>Restoring of it again</hi>] that it might be believed: and why may not God <hi>foretell the Period</hi> when
<hi>Antichriſts Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries ſhall be caſt out alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="321">321. And in his other Inſtance of
<hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> God granted his Church ſome <hi>Prophets</hi> in thoſe <hi>bad times,</hi> to reveal his Counſel <hi>concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the iſſue of his Idolatry,</hi> 2 Kin. 21.10. &amp; 2 Chron. 33.10.

It was foretold, that though this curſed Woman <hi>eſcape the ſword of Hazael, yet Jehu ſhould ſlay her,</hi> 1 Kin. 19.7. compar'd with 2 Kin.
9.35,36,37. notwithſtanding all <hi>her Painting,</hi> v. 30.</p>
               <p n="322">322. Now was the Lord thus <hi>gracious</hi> to his
<hi>Church</hi> under the <hi>Old Teſt.</hi> to fortell what ſhould become of this <hi>painted Strumpet</hi> (that for a long time had baniſh'd Gods Prophets, perſecuted his People, and ſet up the Worſhip of <hi>Baal</hi> (painting her ſelf, and attiring her head, to make <hi>Jehu</hi> (the King) fall in love with her, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 9.30. and will not the Lord tell his Church under the <hi>New Teſt.</hi> what ſhall become of this <hi>Scarlet Whore</hi> (whereof <hi>Jeza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> was a Type, as before) who hath

                  <hi>the Kings of the Earth ſo long with her Painted attirements?</hi> Yes, the Lord hath ſaid that (<hi>after her Leaſe of</hi> 42 <hi>Months</hi>) <hi>God will raiſe up ſome</hi> Jehu's <hi>to hate this Whore, and to burn her with fire,</hi> Rev. 16.17.</p>
               <p n="323">323. This leads me to a 3d <hi>Opinion</hi> (which I ſhall ſpeak to alſo by way of Refutation) which is not only the Judgement of this very learned <hi>Author</hi> aforeſaid, but of many other
<hi>judicious Divines,</hi> to wit, that the 1260 Days, or 42 Months are not to be taken <hi>literally</hi> but <hi>myſtically,</hi> and that they do not denote any certain <hi>definite Time</hi> in reſpect of Human Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, but only this, that God in his Counſel hath determin'd a
<hi>ſet bound and limit</hi> to the Perſecution of his Church, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be paſſed over, and though this be <hi>certain</hi> to God, yet
'tis <hi>uncertain</hi> to us, for <hi>'tis not given to us to know times and ſeaſons,</hi> Acts 1.7.</p>
               <p n="324">324, I muſt confeſs, this <hi>Notion</hi> ſeems both <hi>plauſible, ſafe,</hi> and ſuch as would <hi>put an end to many Controverſies</hi> about the various com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations of this Number. Yea, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miſtakes of holy and learned Men (about Calculating it) may be thought ſome kind of Confirmation of it. Yet how it can be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, with any <hi>Faith in Gods word,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſatisfie my ſelf for thoſe following <hi>Reaſons.</hi> 1. The title of the book (call'd a
<hi>Revelation</hi>) ſhow, that it is a manifeſtation of Gods ſecret
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:95127:78"/> Counſel concerning his Church, and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the
<hi>World,</hi> in order to his <hi>Church</hi> (both the <hi>fata Imperii &amp; Eccleſiae</hi>) to the end of the World.</p>
               <p n="325">325. And this not only in <hi>general terms,</hi> but it is a <hi>diſtinct and particular Diſcovery</hi> of all the eminent paſſages and pauſes of Providence, that appertains unto the
<hi>Church</hi> in the World; It was a <hi>Revelation</hi> given by the Father to the Son (as he was the Churches Mediator) to <hi>acquaint his Servant with it,</hi> and not to keep it to himſelf. Now we may not ſay, that God reveal'd thoſe concernments of the Church in <hi>general terms</hi> only to
<hi>his Son,</hi> or that this <hi>Lion of the tribe of Judah,</hi> did not open this ſealed Book wide (or well) enough: this would not have ſtayed
<hi>Johns</hi> great Weeping, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.6,8. and beſides, it takes away a great part of that Comfort (for which this book of the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was given to the Church in thoſe Ages of her Perſecution) to ſay, it contains only <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Intimations,</hi> and is not a <hi>diſtinct Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="326">326. My 2d <hi>Reaſon</hi> or Argument againſt this Opinion is, It makes the <hi>Antè-Nati</hi> to ſee and know more then the <hi>Poſt-Nati:</hi> the <hi>old Teſtam. Church</hi> (that was before Chriſt) to have greater Priviledges then the <hi>new Teſtam. Church</hi> that was after him: as if the <hi>former of thoſe two Men</hi> (<hi>which bare the cluſter of Grapes</hi> 
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:95127:79"/>

               </p>
               <p n="327">327. The <hi>Old Teſtam.

<hi>diſtinctly revealed</hi> to her, how long her <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage</hi> in Spiritual <hi>Egypt,</hi> her <hi>Captivity</hi> in My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
<hi>Babylon,</hi> and her <hi>Perſecution</hi> under <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> (whereof <hi>Antiochus</hi> was the Type) <hi>ſhall continue?</hi> This is to advance the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges by <hi>Moſes,</hi> above thoſe by the
<hi>Meſſiah,</hi> as if the <hi>Twilight</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in her Minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and <hi>Nonage</hi> (under <hi>Shadows</hi> and <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>) exceeded the <hi>Noon-day</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel-Church,</hi> which hath her face towards Chriſt, and to which <hi>God hath ſpoken by his Son,</hi> Heb.
1.1,2,</p>
               <p n="328">328. A third <hi>Argument</hi> or Reaſon againſt this Opinion is, when an <hi>indefinite time</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Holy Ghoſt by a <hi>definite.</hi> His manner is, not to uſe Phraſes wherein
<hi>broken</hi> Numbers are, but <hi>whole,</hi> as in thoſe words of

<hi>Act.</hi> 7.6. and the other is 430. Years, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.41.
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. Now the reaſon of this difference, is the <hi>different placing of the Foot of the Accompt;</hi> for the firſt <hi>accompt</hi> begins at <hi>the Birth of Iſaac,</hi> which according to ſtrict Calculation, makes 405. which <hi>broken Number</hi> is omitted in the whole, for in a great Number, ſo <hi>ſmall a Number</hi> comes under no

               </p>
               <p n="346">346. It follows then, if there were ſo much difficulty in computing thoſe Numbers, (both of <hi>Iſraels bondage in Egypt,</hi> and of their <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity in Babylon,</hi> whereof there were <hi>infallible Chronologies,</hi> and <hi>infallible Prophets</hi> to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret them) If (I ſay) there were any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes then, about the commencement and determination of thoſe years, (as <hi>the time is come,</hi> and <hi>the time is not come</hi>) it muſt not be wondred at now, if ſo many Learned men

               <p n="347">347. And here I ſhall take occaſion to ſhew, that
<hi>Antichriſt</hi> is not look'd on as a <hi>domeſtick Foe,</hi> (according to the Notion in <hi>Paragr.</hi> 304) for his afflicting the Church, is compared to the <hi>bondage of Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Captivity of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> (both which were Extrinſick, not Intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick Foes) hence the

               <p n="348">348.

                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:95127:84"/> forenamed, to wit, the <hi>uncertainty of Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> the <hi>variety of Periods,</hi> and the <hi>difficulty</hi> (even) of <hi>Scriptural Computations</hi> expreſly declared by God, and now already fulfilled by him.</p>

               <p n="350">350. To find out therefore by <hi>Scripture-light</hi> what I conceive moſt <hi>probable</hi> about this <hi>great Subject,</hi> I ſhall wave thoſe <hi>numbers of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> (which ſo many have inſiſted on, as before manifeſted) becauſe they are obvious to ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Exceptions, (<hi>As that they have already had their accompliſhment in</hi> Antiochus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] and keep to the <hi>Apocaliptick number,</hi> againſt which no ſuch exception can be made.</p>

               <p n="352">352. And it being taken [<hi>pro Conceſſo</hi>] like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that thoſe 1260 Days are not <hi>Solar days</hi> (either

13.7.</p>
               <p n="371">371, A third <hi>Argument</hi> to prove
<hi>Antichriſt</hi> this Beaſt is, from his <hi>Identity with the</hi> 2d
<hi>Beaſt,</hi> which all acknowledge to be <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> for
<hi>Antichriſt</hi> doth not always appear in one ſhape, but ſometimes in
<hi>one</hi> ſhape, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in <hi>another;</hi> ſometimes as
<hi>Dominus in Temporalibus,</hi> and ſo he makes himſelf the
<hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and at other times, as <hi>Dominus in Spiritualibus,</hi> and ſo he becomes their <hi>Aaron</hi> or High-Prieſt. and though he got his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral power after his Spiritual (ſo tis the younger of the two) yet it is firſt repreſented, as <hi>Moſes</hi> (the younger Brother) is <hi>placed before Aaron</hi> the Elder.</p>
               <p n="372">372. This Opinion may not ſeem impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that both the 2 <hi>Beasts</hi> hold out one <hi>Antichriſt:</hi> for the firſt
<hi>reaſon is,</hi> one Elephant (<hi>propter ingentem magnitudinem, quâ inſtar plurium eſt</hi>) for his vaſt bigneſs, is called
<hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemoth</hi> (Job 40.15.) which is the <hi>Hebr. plur.</hi>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:95127:90"/> 
                  <hi>foem.</hi> as if many Beaſts in one, why may not this great Monſter (<hi>Antichriſt</hi>) be reſembled by <hi>two Beaſts,</hi> who indeed is a compound of <hi>many beasts</hi> (all Hereſies centring in him) or a <hi>Beast of beasts</hi> (as the Song of ſongs) by way of Eminency: and as the Elephant is ſaid to be <hi>the chiefeſt of the ways of God,</hi> Job 40.19. ſo <hi>Antichrist is chiefest of the ways of Satan,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.9. <hi>ut ſuprá.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="373">373. The (2d) <hi>reaſon</hi> (that makes it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable) is, if the firſt <hi>Beast</hi> do not hold out
<hi>Antichrist,</hi> then the Holy Ghoſt hath not (at all) ſet down the term of <hi>Antichrists</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in the World; which is contrary to the whole current of Expoſitors, who all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Term of
<hi>Antichriſts</hi> Reign to be included in the 42 Months, or 1260 days or years of the <hi>first Beast.</hi> Now we do not find any ſuch <hi>expreſs terms</hi> of Time about the 2d <hi>Beast,</hi> how long he ſhall continue: as to that number of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> 666. I have ſhew'd at large (<hi>ut ſupra</hi>) that it cannot hold out the Number of his Beginning nor of his Ending, which a little Arithmetick or <hi>Human Wiſdom</hi> might eaſily compute, and this is not call'd <hi>Wiſdom with God, the wiſdom of this World is fooliſhneſs with God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.20.</p>
               <p n="374">374. But laſtly the third <hi>Reaſon</hi> which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it moſt probable is, that thoſe two <hi>Beasts</hi> are one and the ſame, becauſe there is but <hi>one Beaſt</hi> mentioned in
<hi>Rev.</hi> 17.8. (which is the<pb n="168" facs="tcp:95127:91"/> Holy Ghoſts interpretation of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the 13. <hi>chap.</hi>) he doth not ſpeak of <hi>two Beasts,</hi> but (<hi>the Beaſt which thou ſaw,</hi> &amp;c.) as in <hi>Daniel,</hi> the interpretation of the Viſions follows the Viſions themſelves, ſo doth <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. interpret the Viſion of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> in <hi>chap.</hi> 13. yea, Mr. <hi>Medes</hi> (notion of the 10 <hi>Popiſh Kings</hi>) and Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> (of the

               </p>
               <p n="375">375. Thoſe things being premiſed, I come more clearly to ſpeak of <hi>the healing of this deadly wound</hi> in this 6th
<hi>Head,</hi> which we find in Hiſtory, to be done not <hi>per ſaltum,</hi> but gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually, as an old wound (of an 140 Y. ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) required: the <hi>firſt Plaister</hi> that was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to it, was by
<hi>Justinian</hi> the <hi>Emperor,</hi> in the 5. Century, not only by the
<hi>Expulſion</hi> of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> out of <hi>Italy</hi> by his two Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, <hi>Belliſarius</hi> and <hi>Narſes,</hi> but eſpecially by his <hi>Constitutions</hi> (call'd <hi>Novellae &amp; Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticae</hi>) wherein the Decree was, that the <hi>Biſhop of old</hi> Rome according to the Canons of the holy Councels <hi>ſhould have the Primacy of all Priests.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="376">376. But aſſuredly it was never <hi>perfectly healed,</hi> till <hi>Phocas</hi> (the Parricide) <hi>cloſed</hi> up the

               <p n="385">385. A 3d. <hi>Incumbrance</hi> that this

               <p n="386">386. But then 5ly. The Flood of <hi>Arria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm</hi> muſt precede the <hi>Riſing of the Beaſt,</hi> which took up a great Interſpace after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying of the <hi>Dragon:</hi> This
<hi>Hereſy</hi> continued <hi>ſome hundreds</hi> of years, and was a long time publickly received in the Church, ſpreading it ſelf univerſally
<hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt,</hi> from thence <hi>Jerom</hi> [<hi>Ingemuit totus Orbis, &amp; ſe Arria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num miratus eſt</hi>] and perſecuting the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, (under <hi>Conſtantius</hi>) beyond all the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,</hi> till the Earth (which help'd the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.16.) of the

And (<hi>Ignotum per Ignotius</hi>) a dark by a darker, can never be any good demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative Argument, to find out the certainty of any Poſtulatum or Queſtion whatſoever: Thoſe Ambiguities both about <hi>the Beaſts War,</hi> and about <hi>the Womans flight,</hi> makes them the leſs demonſtrative: for there ſeems to be a
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:95127:94"/> double accompt of both; Of the <hi>Beaſts War</hi> one is, <hi>againſt the Remnant,</hi> when the Church was got from the Dragon into the Wilderneſs, (as <hi>Iſrael</hi> from <hi>Pharaoh</hi> into the deſert) then began that War with her Seed, that could not get into the Wilderneſs with her, ſo had not Temples nor Prophets to <hi>feed</hi> and

<hi>Natural.</hi> 1.

               </p>
               <p n="427">427. A 2d <hi>ground</hi> of this Hope is, this
<hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſheth Antichriſts end,</hi> which is twofold, 1ſt. a
<hi>rendring the Witneſſes contemptible,</hi> this is obtained by putting them out of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying-work, for thereby they lay (as <hi>dead men in the ſtreet,</hi> Rev. 11.8.) like <hi>deſpiſed bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Idols, in whom there is no pleaſure:</hi> and ſo is his 2d end too obtain'd by a civil Death, to <pb n="195" facs="tcp:95127:104"/> wit, a <hi>freeing himſelf from their tormenting him,</hi> Rev. 10.11. which they did as Prophets (in their Prophecying-work) and not as <hi>Men.</hi> A 3d <hi>ground</hi> of this Hope is, <hi>their Slaughter ſhall be like their Reſurrection,</hi> now as their
<hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi> is <hi>myſtical</hi> and <hi>metaphorical,</hi> and not <hi>real</hi> (for no Reſurrection (properly ſo call'd) <hi>can be before the Coming of Chriſt,</hi> under the 7th Trumpet) but this <hi>comes to paſs</hi> while the 6th Trumpet is in being (as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> ſhews) therefore their <hi>Slaughter then ſhall be civil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="428">428. A 4th <hi>ground</hi> is taken from the

<hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,</hi> becauſe he found that [<hi>ſanguis Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> was

               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:95127:113"/>8. And though we find ſeveral of thoſe <hi>ancient Witneſſes to prophecy in Sackcloth,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, thoſe two forenamed, who were for a long time in a <hi>mournfull ſuffering eſtate</hi> for their <hi>Teſtimony</hi> againſt thoſe
<hi>Hereſies,</hi> &amp;c. Yet may not we take them for thoſe
<hi>Sackcloth-prophecies</hi> in Rev. 11.3. becauſe their <hi>Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth</hi> was put on upon other <hi>accounts,</hi> to wit, for the <hi>Hereſies</hi> aforeſaid, &amp;c. and not upon the <hi>account</hi> of this <hi>Romiſh Beaſt</hi> that was to <hi>tread down the holy City,</hi> for

               </p>
               <p n="9">9. In the following Ages, when the <hi>man of Sin</hi> began to prevail, God raiſed up <hi>godly and learned Miniſters,</hi> who in every Century op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the <hi>Romiſh Doctrines, defending</hi> the
